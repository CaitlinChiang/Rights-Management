Problem: The modern world wants to make an effort in collaborating with indigenous communities, and this includes finding more data about them in order to stay informed and have a deeper understanding of them. The issue is that there is not a ton of open information available to the public -- and if there were, some information were not consented to be displayed to public. 

Solution: We wanted to conceptualize a solution that allows indigenous communities to share information to the world with their own consent and willingness to share, by providing a platform for them to post details about their community. This ensures that all that is public in this website are content that they chose to make public, therefore protecting what needs to be kept from the world, whilst allowing the general public to have a deeper understanding of their culture.
